    "## Compliance model\n",
    "Lungs have a static compliance (typ 0.2 L/cmH2O) and a dynamic compliance with a corresponding exponential time constant of typically 0.5 s. The air in the system will also have some interial resistance which will depend on its kinematic viscosity and volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "These can be modeled as a spring-mass-damper system. For mechanical ventilation, this is analogous to a forced spring-mass-damper system where the volume flow rate is imposed, leading to an imposed inspired volume over time, and the pressure response can then be determined as a function of time following:\n",

For the homogeneous part the sign of $c^2 - 4mk$ determines the form of the solution, and it will typically be positive as $m$ is quite small. \n",
